   <p>Here are some of my old projects that were made before this course.  </p>

   <h2><a href="https://forward28.github.io/Sailing-boat-Froken-Yr/" target="_blank">Sailing Boat Froken Yr</a></h2>
   <p>My home page, which was made about 3 years ago. On the flash drive everything works great, but in GitHub for some reason some pages are glitchy. 
   Not finished, as was learning project. Made in Russian, but if can be translated by Browser. 
   Most likely it does not meet modern requirements for web page development, since this is the first project and was made with the help of 
   Google and other resources that help you make a page yourself, without having IT skills.</p>
<hr>
   <h2>FIGMA projects</h2>
   <p> 2 projects in Figma, which were made 2 years after the home page was ready. <br>
   I tried to adapt Figma's project's to the home page. <br>
    Desktop and mobile prototype versions. More advanced than Homepage above. As well as WEB version - it is learning version. <br>
    Not finished, but most features is actual and working.</p>
